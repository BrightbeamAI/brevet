# Changelog

## 0.1.0 (2026-07-12)

First public release. (Developed under the working name *Praxis*; renamed to
*Brevet* before release: the PyPI/import name `praxis` belongs to an
unrelated JAX library, and several AI projects already share that name.)

- Visual documentation: loop, envelope, authority-ladder, and
  employee-analogy diagrams plus an animated demo GIF (`docs/assets/`), an
  interactive story tour (`docs/demo.html`), and a project glossary
  (`GLOSSARY.md`).

- `brevet.wrap()`: zero-config wrapping with auto-detection for ten
  frameworks: LangGraph, Claude Agent SDK, DeepAgents, AutoGen, LlamaIndex,
  Pydantic AI, Google ADK, CrewAI, OpenAI Agents SDK, and any callable.
- Override harvesting: the draft/final diff is classified refining vs
  substituting and chained as evidence, no manual annotation.
- The delta engine (`dream`): clusters overrides by failure signature and
  emits Evidence-layer candidate capability objects with provenance.
- Dawn gate: human-only promotion (`promote | hold | reject | re_elicit`);
  approver identities in `agent:*`, `model:*`, `dream:*` namespaces are
  rejected.
- Override-compiled evals with deterministic held-in/held-out splits and the
  conservative acceptance gate.
- Signed releases (Ed25519 over canonical JSON) with `capabilities.lock`,
  the Capability Bill of Materials.
- Recall: CVE-style capability withdrawal with affected-release enumeration,
  provable from the evidence chain alone.
- Hash-linked append-only evidence ledger with independent replay
  (`verify`).
- MCP server (`brevet mcp`) exposing the full lifecycle; authority
  invariants hold over MCP.
- Optional local model assist via Ollama (drafts only, always logged, fails
  soft to deterministic templates).
- Optional live CHAP mirroring with an offline-tolerant outbox.
- Five JSON Schemas as the normative contract (`schemas/`), a normative
  spec (`SPEC.md`), and a benchmark design note (`BENCHMARK.md`).
